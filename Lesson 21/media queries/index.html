	Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
	industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
	ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
	and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
	only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
	remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
	with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
	and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
	including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
