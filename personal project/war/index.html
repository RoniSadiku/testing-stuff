<br><br>

<p id="ww2">World war 2 began in 1940 and ended in 1945. This war was one of the most memorable wars of all time. The WW2 is known to have 3 dictatorial parties who lead the countries. The Nazi with Hitler in the lead (leaders of germany), Communism lead by Stalin (BRSS leader) and fashism (lead by Bennito Mussolini). So after WW1 there was an union created named Nationial Union which included a bunch of contries. In this Union Germany also took part in and stayed for some time. When Hitler got control of the Country he immidetly decided to leave the National Union and started working on its own. Hitler was a very strict leader who got control by force and has also been in jail. As a kid he enjoyed artistic stuff. He was a painter who was born in Austia and moved to Germany. People didnt like his paintings and he decided to leave that passion and develop a new passion about politics and world leading. He was unhinged for the things he said and did and was also arrested during some point. When he got free he immidetly started working on the world leading and creating his own parti to participate on the leader chosing. His party was called Nazi and they promised to see Germany on top. When Hitler got control he immidetly started killing any other race execpt whites. He also was racist towards jews and killed and masacred a bunch of them. After the Cleansing he started working on politics and started thinking about territory gain. He took Cyprus and took half of Poland where he was met with russia. Hitler didnt like having other enemies so during the end of the war he declared war towards Russia and Usa. It is sayed that Hitler killed himself and his Wife in a bunker at an unkown location. </p>
